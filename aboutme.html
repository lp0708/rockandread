                    <h2>Hey there, I'm Lahari üëãüèª</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Rock and Read! 
                        <p>If you havent figured it out already, I'm into books and music, and I created this platform to share my favorite reads and songs with the world. 
                    I believe that every book has its melody, and every song tells a story. Through Rock and Read, I hope you can find a connection between these two beautiful art forms.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not reading or listening to music, you'll find me writing poetry or in band practice. Yes, I sing!

                    <p>Feel free to explore the website, and I hope you find a book or song that resonates with you while you're here ‚ú®üåπ</p>
